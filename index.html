              We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know
              it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
              trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent&#39;s
              evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
              evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of
              electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this species in the

              wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you&#39;ve made your

            Pokémon Go&#39;s Types are exactly the same as those in the main
            Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly
            different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have
            slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although
            a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.

              Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release

              these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released
              sometime after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon
              Red and Blue for international release. The original Green version
